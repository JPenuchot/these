This thesis is about metaprogramming techniques for parallel code generation.
It aims to study the boundary between compile-time parsing of
\glspl{dsel} and high performance code generation in \cpp.

The main motivation is to provide tools, libraries, and guidelines for embedding
mathematical languages in \cpp with the hope that it can be useful to build a
cohesive set of tools to make generic \gls{hpc} more accessible
to non-expert audiences. This goal is even more important as new computing
architectures emerge over time. Developing high performance programs requires
tuned implementations that can be achieved by either specializing
implementations for the target platforms, or using libraries that provide
specialized abstractions at various levels and for various domains.

% TODO - Loi de Moore etc...

Years after its introduction, Moore's law is still doing alive and well:
transistor count is still doubling every year despite people claiming
it is not alive anymore. This is due to a common confusion between
transistor count and computing power. While transistor count has been steadily
rising, the throughput computing performance of single \gls{cpu} cores has not.

% TODO - Qu'est-ce que le parallelisme (la fin du free lunch -> on parallelise)

The need for more parallel software is driven by the fact that processors have
become increasingly parallel \cite{concurrency-revolution} in order to
compensate for the lack of serial execution performance improvements.

% TODO: Flynn citation
Flynn's taxonomy describes four ways in which computers can perform operations
concurrently or not:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\textbf{\gls{mimd}}, which consists in having several processors or cores
executing different proccesses. This category of parallelism itself has several
sub-categories depending on the memory topology:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Shared memory}, where processing units share a single
  pool of memory. Multi-threading is an example of such a topology as
  CPU cores share the same pool of RAM.
  \item \textbf{Distributed memory}, where processing units have their own
  memories and cannot access other memory pools.
  \item \textbf{Distributed shared memory}, where processing units have their
  own memory pools and can access other memory pools indirectly.
  \end{itemize}

\item
\textbf{\gls{misd}}, which is primarily used for fault tolerance by having
execution redundancy.

\item
\textbf{\gls{simd}}, which is a parallelism that can be implemented inside
a single \gls{cpu} core by having vector registers. These registers can hold
several values, and single instructions can operate on the vectors themselves.

\item
\textbf{\gls{sisd}}, where a computer only has a single processor with no
vector registers.

\end{itemize}

Note that these categories are not always mutually exclusive.
Modern \glspl{cpu} in personal computers nowadays have multiple cores,
each one of them having vector registers. Therefore, modern \glspl{cpu}
leverage a mix of SIMD and MIMD computing to achieve higher throughput.

% TODO - Quels sont les grands outils (citer les rapporteureuses)?

% TODO - on en vient aux dsel, a la metaprog constexpr...

% TODO - on en vient a la mesure du compile time

% TODO - Objectifs de la these: on se creuse sur tout ca...

The objective of this thesis is to develop and assess new ways to write
\cpp metaprograms that enable better compile time performance, as well as
better maintainability by using


% TODO   - C'est complique la programmation parallele (3 vendeurs de \glspl{gpu}???)
% TODO     du coup on fait des outils qui generent du code parallele
% TODO   - Exposer la problematique des methodes de bench pour la meta + la repro
% TODO - Detail du plan
