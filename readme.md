# PhD thesis document

[Read it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpenuchot/these/main/main.pdf)

This is a public repository for my PhD thesis.
I'm using it mostly to keep track of my work,
have a CI to build document previews frequently,
and make it available to curious readers.

You'll see me working on it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

## What this is about

C++ metaprogramming techniques, embedding languages in C++ using
`constexpr` programming for parsing, studying the thin barrier between
`constexpr` function output and C++ templates for code generation,
generic programming for high performance computing,
and compiler execution time analysis.

## Who this is for

My PhD advisor, C++ nerds, or anyone else interested in metaprogramming or HPC.
