  abstract = {Concurrency has long been touted as the "next big thing" and "the
              way of the future," but for the past 30 years, mainstream software
              development has been able to ignore it. Our parallel future has
              finally arrived: new machines will be parallel machines, and this
              will require major changes in the way we develop software. The
              introductory article in this issue describes the hardware
              imperatives behind this shift in computer architecture from
              uniprocessors to multicore processors, also known as CMPs.},
