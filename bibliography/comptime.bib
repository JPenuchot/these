  abstract = {Template metaprogramming is an emerging new direction in C++
              programming for executing algorithms in compilation time. Despite
              all of its already proven benefits and numerous successful
              applications, it is yet to be accepted in industrial projects. One
              reason is the lack of professional software tools supporting the
              development of template metaprograms. A strong analogue exists
              between traditional runtime programs and compile-time metaprograms.
              This connection presents the possibility for creating development
              tools similar to those already used when writing runtime programs.
              This paper introduces Templight, a debugging framework that reveals
              the steps executed by the compiler during the compilation of C++
              programs with templates. Templight's features include following the
              instantiation chain, setting breakpoints, and inspecting
              metaprogram information. This framework aims to take a step forward
              to help template metaprogramming become more accepted in the
              software industry.},
