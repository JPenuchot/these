              model for multi-processor architectures and its implementation
              using C++ template meta-programming. Experimental results asses
              this model and its implementation on sample computation kernels.},

  abstract = {C++ Template Metaprogramming sheds light on the most powerful
              idioms of today's C++, at long last delivering practical
              metaprogramming tools and techniques into the hands of the everyday
              programmer.A metaprogram is a program that generates or manipulates
              program code. Ever since generic programming was introduced to C++,
              programmers have discovered myriad "template tricks" for
              manipulating programs as they are compiled, effectively eliminating
              the barrier between program and metaprogram. While excitement among
              C++ experts about these capabilities has reached the community at
              large, their practical application remains out of reach for most
              programmers. This book explains what metaprogramming is and how it
              is best used. It provides the foundation you'll need to use the
              template metaprogramming effectively in your own work.This book is
              aimed at any programmer who is comfortable with idioms of the
              Standard Template Library (STL). C++ power-users will gain a new
              insight into their existing work and a new fluency in the domain of
              metaprogramming. Intermediate-level programmers who have learned a
              few advanced template techniques will see where these tricks fit in
              the big picture and will gain the conceptual foundation to use them
              with discipline. Programmers who have caught the scent of
              metaprogramming, but for whom it is still mysterious, will finally
              gain a clear understanding of how, when, and why it works. All
              readers will leave with a new tool of unprecedented power at their
              disposal-the Boost Metaprogramming Library.The companion CD-ROM
              contains all Boost C++ libraries, including the Boost
              Metaprogramming Library and its reference documentation, along with
              all of the book's sample code and extensive supplementary material.
