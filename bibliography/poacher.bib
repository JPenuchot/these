  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter demonstrates how to leverage the
              Thrust parallel template library to implement high performance
              applications with minimal programming effort. With the introduction
              of CUDA C/C++, developers can harness the massive parallelism of
              the graphics processing unit (GPU) through a standard programming
              language. CUDA allows developers to make fine-grained decisions
              about how computations are decomposed into parallel threads and
              executed on the device. The level of control offered by CUDA C/C++
              is an important feature; it facilitates the development of
              high-performance algorithms for a variety of computationally
              demanding tasks which merit significant optimization and profit
              from low-level control of the mapping onto hardware. With Thrust,
              developers describe their computation using a collection of
              high-level algorithms and completely delegate the decision of how
              to implement the computation to the library. Thrust is implemented
              entirely within CUDA C/C++ and maintains interoperability with the
              rest of the CUDA ecosystem. Interoperability is an important
              feature because no single language or library is the best tool for
              every problem. Thrust presents a style of programming emphasizing
              genericity and composability. Indeed, the vast majority of Thrust's
              functionality is derived from four fundamental parallel
              algorithms—for each, reduce, scan, and sort. Thrust's high-level
              algorithms enhance programmer productivity by automating the
              mapping of computational tasks onto the GPU. Thrust also boosts
              programmer productivity by providing a rich set of algorithms for
              common patterns.},
