  abstract = {Julia is a programming language for the scientific community that
              combines features of productivity languages, such as Python or
              MATLAB, with characteristics of performance-oriented languages,
              such as C++ or Fortran. Julia's productivity features include:
              dynamic typing, automatic memory management, rich type annotations,
              and multiple dispatch. At the same time, Julia allows programmers
              to control memory layout and leverages a specializing just-in-time
              compiler to eliminate much of the overhead of those features. This
              paper details the design choices made by the creators of Julia and
              reflects on the implications of those choices for performance and
              usability.},
